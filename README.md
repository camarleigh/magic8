###Author and push a README (in plain text or markdown) that describes 
your project:

##What is the goal of the project?
- The goal is pure entertainment. Focus on js skills and mastery.

##Who is the target audience (can be just yourself)?
- Me and anyone who's familiar with "The Golden Girls" television show. Again - entertainment value only.

##What are your personal learning goals?
-Become more comfortable with js and css. 

##What technologies/frameworks/patterns will you be employing?
- While I initially intended to make this a "full stack" project I did some research online. I'm going to make this project fully html/css/js.

##What are the tech and/or skill dependencies of your project?
- This will be a heavily front-end project that emphasizes some UX and UI aspects. 

##What does success look like for this project? What does "done" mean?
- "Done" means a functioning page with text box that hides on submit and then displays a GG witticism/meme. While I'd like to implement some sort of "shaking" or "wheel of fortune" - type graphic that may be beyond current reach and I'll have to implement at a later time.  

###Create a Trello board in which you decompose the tasks and deliverables of the project.

#marleigh -  magic8
Mini-capstone Labor Day Week Project

I'm thinking about doing a Golden Girls themed magic 8 ball. 
The animation will probably be a challenge and just like a magic 8 ball the question answered won't really matter unless I decide to build in the ability to see whether a question is being asked repeatedly. 

So,  
index#home
 text box to enter a question. Javascript and CSS animated 8 ball taking up most of the screen. General directions on how to use the magic 8 ball. 

index#answer
  on a click event the quote "floats up" to the top, probably with a pic or meme of the one of the four golden girls.
concerns 
  I'm still thinking about how to involve the db more than just holding the initial quotes and images.
  I will attempt to deployto heroku as well.
